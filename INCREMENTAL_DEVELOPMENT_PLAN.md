# Incremental Development and Design Plan
## Check List Plans - Engineering Plan Management System

Following the **Incremental Development and Design** methodology, this document outlines a step-by-step approach to building and evolving the Check List Plans system. Each increment builds upon the previous one while continuously improving the design to support future features.

---

## Current System Analysis

The Check List Plans application is a React-based web application for managing engineering checklists with the following key components:

### Current Architecture:
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with Bootstrap 5.3.8
- **State Management**: React Context API (AppContext, SideBarContext)
- **Build System**: Vite with ESLint
- **Components**: Modular component structure with containers pattern
- **Features**: PDF viewing, checklist management, drawing mode, responsive sidebar

### Current Features:
1. **Plan Selection**: Dropdown to switch between different engineering plans
2. **Dynamic Checklists**: Pre-defined sections (Elevatie, Sectiuni, etc.) with checkable items
3. **PDF Viewer**: Display engineering plans as PDFs with overlay canvas
4. **Drawing Mode**: Add green checkmarks and text annotations on PDFs
5. **Sidebar Management**: Add/edit/delete sections and items
6. **Mobile Blocker**: Desktop-only experience
7. **Responsive Layout**: Resizable sidebar

---

## 1. Initial Feature Selection

### **Core Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
**Feature**: Basic static checklist display with PDF viewer

**Why this is the logical starting point:**
- Provides immediate value to users (view plans + see what needs to be checked)
- Establishes core UI layout (PDF left, checklist right)
- Minimal complexity - no state management beyond plan selection
- Foundation for all other features

**Components needed:**
- Simple PDF viewer (iframe)
- Static checklist display
- Basic plan selection dropdown
- Fixed sidebar layout

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Development and Design Plan

### **Stage 1: Static Foundation**
**Implement:**
- Static PDF display in iframe
- Fixed checklist with hardcoded sections and items
- Basic two-column layout (PDF | Checklist)
- Single plan support
- Read-only checkboxes for UI demonstration

**Refactor/Design:**
- Separate concerns: create `PdfViewer` and `ChecklistDisplay` components
- Establish component props interface for future data injection
- Create basic CSS layout system for responsive design
- Design data structure for checklist items: `{text: string, checked: boolean}`

**Justification:**
This establishes the core user interface and user experience. Users can immediately see the value proposition (plan + checklist side by side) without complex interactions. The design separates display logic from future state management.

---

### **Stage 2: Basic Interactivity**
**Implement:**
- Checkbox state management (check/uncheck items)
- Local state storage using React useState
- Plan selection dropdown with 2-3 hardcoded plans
- Different checklists per plan type

**Refactor/Design:**
- Introduce centralized state management structure
- Create `useChecklist` custom hook for state logic
- Design plan-to-checklist mapping system
- Abstract checklist data into constants file
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Justification:**
Adds the primary user interaction (checking items off) while keeping complexity minimal. The custom hook pattern prepares for more complex state management while the plan mapping establishes the foundation for dynamic plan loading.

---

### **Stage 3: Dynamic Content Management**
**Implement:**
- Add new sections to checklists
- Add/edit/delete individual checklist items
- Section name editing
- Basic form validation

**Refactor/Design:**
- Elevate state to Context API for better state sharing
- Create dedicated `ChecklistManager` service class
- Implement immutable state updates
- Design CRUD operations interface
- Add proper error handling and user feedback

**Justification:**
This stage makes the application truly dynamic and useful for real work. The Context API refactor prepares for the more complex features (drawing mode) that require state sharing across distant components.

---

### **Stage 4: Visual Annotation System**
**Implement:**
- Canvas overlay on PDF viewer
- Drawing mode toggle
- Click to place green checkmarks on PDF
- Clear all drawings function

**Refactor/Design:**
- Create `DrawingCanvas` component with proper event handling
- Implement canvas coordinate system management
- Design drawing state structure: `{x, y, type, timestamp}`
- Create drawing tools abstraction for future shapes/colors
- Separate drawing logic from PDF viewing logic

**Justification:**
This adds the unique value proposition of visual correlation between checklist and plan. The abstracted drawing system prepares for more sophisticated annotation features.

---

### **Stage 5: Enhanced Drawing Features**
**Implement:**
- Text annotations on click
- Different mark types (checkmark, X, custom text)
- Drawing persistence per plan
- Right-click context menu for mark types

**Refactor/Design:**
- Implement Strategy pattern for different drawing tools
- Create `AnnotationManager` for complex annotation operations
- Design annotation-to-checklist linking system
- Add keyboard shortcuts support infrastructure
- Implement drawing history/undo system foundation

**Justification:**
Provides professional-grade annotation capabilities while establishing patterns for advanced features. The Strategy pattern allows easy addition of new drawing tools.

---

### **Stage 6: Advanced UI/UX Features**
**Implement:**
- Resizable sidebar with drag handle
- Responsive layout optimization
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Improved mobile experience (tablet support)

**Refactor/Design:**
- Create `LayoutManager` for responsive behavior
- Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox optimization
- Design touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Create accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Implement user preferences system

**Justification:**
Enhances user experience for professional daily use. The layout manager and preferences system prepare for user customization features.

---

### **Stage 7: Data Persistence & Management**
**Implement:**
- Local storage for checklist modifications
- Export checklist data as JSON/PDF
- Import custom checklists
- Backup/restore functionality

**Refactor/Design:**
- Implement Repository pattern for data persistence
- Create `DataManager` abstraction for different storage backends
- Design data migration system for future schema changes
- Add data validation and sanitization
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits

**Justification:**
Makes the application production-ready for professional use. The Repository pattern prepares for future cloud storage integration.

---

### **Stage 8: Collaboration Features**
**Implement:**
- Shareable plan URLs with embedded checklist state
- Read-only shared view mode
- Comments on checklist items
- Basic version tracking

**Refactor/Design:**
- Implement URL state serialization
- Create `CollaborationManager` for shared state
- Design comment threading system
- Add user identification system
- Implement optimistic UI updates

**Justification:**
Enables team collaboration while maintaining simple architecture. The URL serialization and collaboration manager prepare for real-time collaboration features.

---

## 3. Progressive Feature Expansion

### **Stage 9: Performance Optimization**
**Implement:**
- PDF lazy loading and caching
- Virtual scrolling for large checklists
- React.memo optimization for frequent re-renders
- Canvas drawing optimization

**Refactor/Design:**
- Implement performance monitoring hooks
- Create `CacheManager` for resource optimization
- Add bundle size optimization
- Design progressive loading system

---

### **Stage 10: Advanced Features**
**Implement:**
- Plan templates system
- Custom checklist templates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Print-friendly layout mode

**Refactor/Design:**
- Create `TemplateEngine` for customizable checklists
- Implement plugin architecture for extensibility
- Design theming system
- Add internationalization support
